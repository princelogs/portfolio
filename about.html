        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm <strong>Prince Kumar</strong>, a passionate and creative web developer with a love for crafting clean, efficient, and responsive websites. My journey in tech started with curiosity and quickly turned into a deep dedication to bringing ideas to life through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a growing knowledge of modern frameworks and tools, I focus on building user-friendly interfaces and pixel-perfect designs. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, sketching UI designs, or diving into a good sci-fi series. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations—let’s create something amazing together!
